/*!
  Routine to compute the dot product of two vectors.

  This routine calls the reference dot-product implementation by default, but
  can be replaced by a custom routine that is optimized and better suited for
  the target system.

  @param[in]  n the number of vector elements (on this processor)
  @param[in]  x, y the input vectors
  @param[out] result a pointer to scalar value, on exit will contain the result.
  @param[out] time_allreduce the time it took to perform the communication between processes
  @param[out] isOptimized should be set to false if this routine uses the reference implementation (is not optimized); otherwise leave it unchanged

  @return returns 0 upon success and non-zero otherwise

  @see ComputeDotProduct_ref
